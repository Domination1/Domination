Game Description:
    This game is comprised of five mini games.
    In each mini-game, the character (a dinosaur) will attempt to overcome the obstacles put in place.
    The Dinosaur's goal is to stay alive from the exploding volcano. 

Mini-Games:
    1. Maze -- Get the Dinosaur out of the cave and into the open.
    2. Dodge lasers 
       - The Earth's magnetic field has broken. Lasers are spewing at you. Make sure you don't die!
    3. Race with your fellow dinosaur to get to the forest first. There is only enough food for one of you!
    4. Shoot the leaves into the basket to make sure you have enough food for the volcano eruption.
    5. Survive the lava by defeating the lava monster (in a quasi-pokemon match) 

Game Audience:
    This game is for children ages 7-19.
